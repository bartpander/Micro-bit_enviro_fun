Set up of Micro:bit Enviro as a weather station logging data, alarm clock and nightlight
This is a bit of Make code to set up a Micro:bit Enviro as a weather station logging data, alarm clock and nightlight
It has been running for over a week now without the log overfilling or the battery getting empty, unknow how long it will last.

Feel free to use it, let me know if you find any issues or made any significant improvements
